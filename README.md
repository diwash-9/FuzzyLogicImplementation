## Fuzzy Logic Crop Yield Prediction

This project uses a fuzzy logic system to predict crop yield based on rainfall, temperature, and soil fertility using the `scikit-fuzzy` library.

### Features
- Fuzzy inference system based on rainfall, temperature, and soil fertility.
- Predicts crop yield using fuzzy logic principles.
- Customizable membership functions and rules.

### Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required:

- `numpy`
- `scikit-fuzzy`

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-fuzzy

jupyter notebook fuzzy_logic_devraj_khatiwada.ipynb
Customization
You can modify the input ranges, membership functions, or fuzzy rules to tailor the system to different crop yield prediction scenarios.
